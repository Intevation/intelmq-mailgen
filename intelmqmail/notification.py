    """The directives for which notifications have to be created.

    This is the mailgen counterpart to the Directive class in the rule
    expert bot in IntelMQ which adds notification directives to the
    events. The main difference is that this class represents a
    collection of those directives. The directives in the collection
    share all of the attributes that were assigned to them by the rules
    in the rule bot and those are available as instance variables with
    the same name in this class, with few exceptions. The exceptions are
    that the attribute ``medium`` is not present here because it's
    always ``'email'`` in mailgen and the ``aggregate_key`` and
    ``aggregate_fields`` attributes are available as one dictionary in
    the :py:attr:`aggregate_identifier` attribute (see also the
    :py:meth:`get_aggregation_item` method). There are also some attributes
    specific to this class: :py:attr:`inserted_at`,
    :py:attr:`last_sent`, :py:attr:`event_ids`,
    :py:attr:`directive_ids`. See below for their documentation.

    Attributes:
        recipient_address (str): The email address of the recipient.
        template_name (str): The name of the template for the contents
            of the notification.
        notification_format (str): The main format of the notification.
        event_data_format (str): The format to use for event data
            included in the notification.
        aggregate_identifier (dict): Additional key/value pairs used
            when aggregating directives. Both keys and values are strings.
        notification_interval (int): Interval between notifications for
            similar events. Can be used together with last_sent to
            determine whether this interval has expired.
        last_sent (datetime): When the last notification with the same
            attributes was sent.
        inserted_at (datetime): When the newest of the directive was
            inserted into the event DB. This can be useful instead of or
            in addition to last_sent and notification_interval.
        event_ids (list of int): The database ids of all events for
            which the directives were created.
        directive_ids (list of int): The database ids of the directives
